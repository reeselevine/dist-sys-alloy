This repository contains Alloy models for different datatypes under distributed consistency models. The models are based on the formalizations in "Principles of Eventual Consistency", by Sebastian Burckhardt (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/final-printversion-10-5-14.pdf).

Additionally, Lorin Hochstein did much of the initial work in porting the formalization from paper to Alloy code, and his code is available here: https://github.com/lorin/alloy-consistency

Currently, the Alloy models here implement many of the datatypes from PEC. Hopefully there is more here to come :).
